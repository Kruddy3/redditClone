~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look into Semantic markup
  -writing things that let you know what is going to happen even without knowing the code.
    element directives are a good example of this

block element vs inline
  -block elements always start a new line (like div) and take up as much space as possible
  -inline elements stay on the same line (like span) take up only as much space as they need

Basics of Flexbox
  -helps distribute space more easily within items in a container
  -you can chose the direction that items are placed in the flexbox and the value assigned dictates the order at which they are placed
  -flexgrow dictates how much space an element within a flexbox can take up
  -justify content allows you to control how much space each element is taking up


Continuing on the path of CSS & HTML I will look at w3 lessons for these
  -HTML
    seems simple enough I dont know if there is something I should be delving into there
  -CSS
    lots of things to memorize here.
      # id selector
      . class selector
        you can chain the selectors with the tag (ie p.class)
    margins and things like this im aware of already just skimming it at this point
